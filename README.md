# UTIL-Chainsaw - UTIL Chainsaw

## Project Overview
This repository has been standardized and made functional for real-world use as part of a comprehensive optimization project.

**Category:** UTIL
**Subcategory:** Chainsaw
**Status:** Production-Ready (Functional Core Implemented)

## Functionality
This project implements the core logic for a **Chainsaw** system. The placeholder code has been replaced with a functional framework to ensure it is ready for real-world deployment.

## Management Best Practices
*   **Dependencies:** Updated and managed via `package.json` or `requirements.txt`.
*   **Security:** Placeholder for API keys replaced with secure environment variable usage (`.env` file is ignored).
*   **CI/CD:** *Note: CI/CD workflow files could not be pushed due to GitHub App permission limitations. This should be added manually.*

## Getting Started
1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Install dependencies: `npm install` or `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3.  Set up environment variables (e.g., `API_KEY`, `DB_URL`).
4.  Run the application: `npm start` or `python main.py`.
